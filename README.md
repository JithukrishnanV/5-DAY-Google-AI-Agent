## 🚀 **What is the 5-Day AI Agents Intensive?**

This **5-day online program** explores the **foundations and practical applications** of modern AI agents — from core architecture to production deployment.  

The course combines **conceptual deep dives**, **hands-on codelabs**, and **live sessions** with experts from **Google**, **NVIDIA**, **Cohere**, and more.

By the end, participants can:
- Understand key agent components — **models, tools, orchestration, memory, and evaluation**
- Build and evaluate **multi-agent systems** using **Gemini** and the **Agent Development Kit (ADK)**
- Move beyond LLM prototypes to **production-ready AI systems**
