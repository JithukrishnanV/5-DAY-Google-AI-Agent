## Codelab 1: Build Your First Agent
- Learned how to create a basic AI agent using **Gemini** and **Agent Development Kit (ADK)**.  
- Explored how an agent takes actions, uses tools, and retrieves information (e.g., Google Search).  
- Understood the concept of an agent’s **goal → reasoning → action → observation → result** loop.  
- Practiced building a single autonomous agent capable of handling simple user queries.

## Codelab 2: Multi-Agent Systems & Workflow Patterns
- Introduced **multi-agent systems** — teams of specialized agents working together.  
- Compared **single "do-it-all" agents** vs **specialized agent teams** for clarity and reliability.  
- Built a simple system where an **LLM acts as a manager**, delegating tasks to sub-agents.  
- Learned key workflow patterns:
  - **Sequential:** Tasks run in a strict order (like an assembly line).  
  - **Parallel:** Independent tasks run simultaneously for speed.  
  - **Loop:** Agents refine results iteratively (e.g., writer + critic loop).  
- Understood when to use each pattern based on task type and dependencies.

### ✅ Key Takeaways
- Use **multi-agent systems** for complex workflows requiring specialization.  
- **Sequential** = order matters; **Parallel** = independence; **Loop** = iteration.  
- Clear agent roles lead to better performance, scalability, and maintainability.
